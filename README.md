# HotelBookingProject
This project aims to analyze hotel booking data to uncover key trends in customer behavior, market segments, and revenue generation. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL, I will identify booking patterns, cancellation trends, and seasonal revenue fluctuations. A fully functional dashboard showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs) will be created using Microsoft Power BI. The insights will help optimize pricing strategies, reduce cancellations, and improve occupancy rates.
This project is an accumulation of my skills in using data analysis tools.
